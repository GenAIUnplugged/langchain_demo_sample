# Chatbot with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

This project is a **Streamlit-based chatbot** that uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to answer user queries. It supports querying data from uploaded files (e.g., `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.txt`) or web URLs. The chatbot leverages **LangChain**, **FAISS**, and **OpenAI's GPT models** for efficient and accurate responses.
